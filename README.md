# AR-Educational-Framework



I developed a Framework built upon Vuforia SDK and Unity, in order to support the development of mobile applications with Augmented Reality, for educational purposes. 
The AR Educational Framework consist on a set of reusable classes (and Unity Prefabs), to implement functionalities, without require none of programmation, and only dragging and placing instead.
This Framework include the followings aspects: 
- The ability to create multiple-choice questions of two possible types.
- The ability to incorporate additional information (3D texts or images) into objects across interaction with markers.
- The ability to change the Transform of objects (rotation or scale), across UI buttons or using interaction with markers.
- The ability to change objects’s Material or the object whole for other, across interaction with markers.
